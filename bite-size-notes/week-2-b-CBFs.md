# Control Barrier Functions 

## Introduction 
In recent years we have had a widespread deployment of autonomous systems, from autonomous vehicles to surgical robots, these systems rely on their ability to perform complex tasks while providing safety assurances. There is a growing increasing number of complex applications with inherent real-world uncertainties using these systems requiring safety-critical autonomous systems... Control barrier functions (CBFs) have recently become a popular technique for **guarenteeing safety** of autonomous systems
