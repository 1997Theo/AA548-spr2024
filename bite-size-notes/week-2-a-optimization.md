# Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Optimization

## Scope and objectives
The note will introduce how the control Lyapunov function could be used to enforce convergence of a system and can be used to reduce the optimal control problem to a sequence of quadratic programs
(QPs).

## Introduction
In the realm of optimal control, the Linear Quadratic Regulator(LQR) was typically used to find the optimal control law that uses minimum control effort to reach an objective for a linear system. For the non-linear system, in order to stabilize the dynamic system while optimizing cost and satisfying safety constraints and control limitations, the control Lyapunov function (CLFs) was typically used to enforce convergence and reduce the optimal control problem to a sequence of quadratic programs(QP). In a trajectory-tracking example, the quadratic programs problem could be formulated as minimizing the quadratic error between the desired control law, which is typically generated by higher-level controllers, and the purposed control law under certain constraints. The carefully designed control Lyapunov function could act as a constraint to guarantee forward invariance of the control to guide the system to the desired location.  

## Preliminaries
### Control Lyapunov Function(CLF)

A CLF is a function \( V: \mathcal{D} \to \mathbb{R} \) that is continuously differentiable and positive definite where there exists \( u \in \mathcal{U} \) such that \( \dot{V}(x) \leq 0 \) for \( \dot{x} = f(x,u) \).

The derivative of \( V \) along trajectories \( \dot{V}(x) = \nabla V(x)^\top f(x,u) \) is less than or equal to zero, which implies **Lyapunov asymptotic stability**.

If \( \nabla V(x)^\top f(x,u) \leq -\alpha V(x) \) for some \( \alpha > 0 \), this indicates **asymptotic stability** in the sense of Lyapunov and is sometimes annotated as **exponential**.

Essentially, the infimum over \( u \in \mathcal{U} \) of \( \nabla V(x)^\top f(x,u) \) should be less than or equal to \(-\alpha V(x)\) for all \( x \in \mathcal{D} \).
